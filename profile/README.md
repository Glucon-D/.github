## 🎯 Who Are We?  
We are **Glucon-D** – the team that runs on **caffeine, chaos, and last-minute debugging**.  
Our motto? **"Code fast, break faster, debug at 3 AM."** 😎  

> "We don’t need sleep, we need funding." – Some Hacker, probably  

## 🔥 What Do We Do?  
🚀 **Build** crazy hackathon projects in **record time** (mostly in the last 2 hours)  
🐛 **Debug** things that were working 5 minutes ago  
💡 **Innovate** until the judges are impressed (or confused 🤣)  
☕ **Survive** on unlimited coffee, Red Bull, and hope

## 🛠 Our Tech Stack (aka, our best friends)  
🔹 **React, Next.js, Node.js** (aka "Let's Google how to fix this")  
🔹 **Python, Flask, Firebase** (Backend is just frontend with extra steps, right?)  
🔹 **Appwrite, MongoDB, MySQL** (We pretend to know SQL 😆)  
🔹 **Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare** (Where we deploy and pray 🙏)  
🔹 **ChatGPT, Copilot** (Our real teammates 🤖)  

## 🏆 Our Hackathon Strategy  
- **Day 1**: Great ideas, super excited, let’s win! 🎉  
- **Day 2**: Sleep is for the weak. Let's pivot the entire project at 2 AM.  
- **Day 3**: WHY IS NOTHING WORKING? 😭  
- **Submission Time**: *It works... kinda... please don’t refresh the page.* 😅
