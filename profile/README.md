## 🎯 Who Are We?  
We are **Glucon-D** – the team that runs on **caffeine, chaos, and last-minute debugging**.  
Our motto? **"Code fast, break faster, debug at 3 AM."** 😎  

> "We don’t need sleep, we need funding." – Some Hacker, probably  

> **"Our code is like a sandwich—sometimes messy, but it holds together… barely."** 🥪  

🎵 **Hackathon Soundtrack:**  
🔊 *"We are young..." plays as our code crashes again*  
🎶 *"Wake me up when it's all over..." plays at 4 AM*  
💀 *"Hello darkness, my old friend..." plays when deployment fails*  

🐱 **Our Developers, 2 AM into the hackathon:**

## 🔥 What Do We Do?  
🚀 **Build** crazy hackathon projects in **record time** (mostly in the last 2 hours).  
🐛 **Debug** things that were working 5 minutes ago.  
💡 **Innovate** until the judges are impressed (or confused 🤣).  
☕ **Survive** on unlimited coffee, Red Bull, and hope.

## 🛠 Our Tech Stack (aka, our best friends)  
🔹 **React, Next.js, Node.js** (aka "Let's Google how to fix this").  
🔹 **Python, Flask, Firebase** (Backend is just frontend with extra steps, right?).  
🔹 **Appwrite, MongoDB, MySQL** (We pretend to know SQL 😆).  
🔹 **Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare** (Where we deploy and pray 🙏).  
🔹 **ChatGPT, Copilot** (Our real teammates 🤖).  

👨‍💻 **When we say we know AI but it's just an if-else statement:**
